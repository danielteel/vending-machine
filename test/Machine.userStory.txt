As a customer, I want to receive change, so that I donâ€™t pay more than the item costs.
- Given I have made a selection, 
- when the item is delivered, 
- then I receive correct change (in correct monetary units)
- `selectItem(code)` returns an object with the item and an array of bills `{item: 'mints', change: [20, 10]}`

As a customer, I want to receive my money back when I push the cancel button, so that I can change my mind.
- Given that I have deposited money,
- When I push the cancel button,
- Then I receive my money back
- `cancel()` returns `{change: [100]}`

As a customer, I want to know if the vending machine can make change, so that I can cancel my choice if it can't make change.
- Given I have deposited money and selected a choice, 
- when the machine does not have correct change, 
- then I see a message
- `selectItem(code)` returns `'Cannot return proper change.  Please choose another item or cancel the transaction'`
